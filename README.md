Network (M30231)
Group Coursework Specification 2023-24
The purpose of this coursework task is to consolidate the fundamental concepts of computer network
infrastructures, as stated in the learning outcomes of the module. This coursework will provide the
opportunity for students to evidence their knowledge and abilities in computer network systems analysis
and design for a given scenario.
This coursework covers the unit Learning Outcomes as stated below:
1. Recognize computer systems network terminology and use it appropriately,
2. Define the fundamental principles of computer networking topologies, security and professional
standards.
5. Examine the fundamental requirements of systems management and security.
6.Identify network security and the impact of network vulnerabilities.

Overview
The premise of this coursework
This is a group coursework that emulates industrial practices, within the computer network industry.
You will work in a group to act as a contractor with the aim to prepare a tender for a given scenario.
During the coursework there will be peer review opportunities to act as a client and feedback on
other group network designs.
These sessions will emulate a staged signoff approach similar to that in industry, for example the
client provides feedback to enhance the presented design for acceptance during each feedback
session.
ALL feedback sessions (peer review sessions) must be attended by ALL group members. The
feedback sessions will be during your normal timetabled sessions. Attendance at these sessions will
form part of the evidence of your individual group contribution.
This document provides the guidelines for the coursework requirements. The client scenario is in a
separate document.

Group Management:
Groups MUST consist of no more than five people from within the same timetabled practical group;
Three or four people may be acceptable but NOT individual (1), less than 2 or more than five.
NOTE: - Cross practical groups will NOT be permitted for this coursework, under any circumstances.
TASK 1 Group Selection and Contract Performa – 5% (Submission 2
nd Feb 2024 by 16:00)
Once you have decided on who is in your group, record your group in Moodle via the ‘Select your group
link’.

*Things to do for Task 1*
Group naming convention:
Please complete the group file description as: practical time_day_tutor name, e.g. 9_Mon_Taiwo
o Complete the ‘Group Contract Performa’. You will find this on Moodle in the coursework
section.
o The Group Contract Performa’ is a ‘terms of reference’ (criteria) that the group agree to
adhere to while working together on this coursework.
o The ‘Group Contract Performa’ consists of the names of all the group members, together with
4 key criteria you all agreed to adhere too, for the duration of this coursework while working as a
group. For example, the group rules on communication or sharing of responsibilities etc.
o Double check that those recorded as being in your group in Moodle are the same students
noted on your submitted Group Performa.
o Only one member of the group needs to upload the submission, as all other group members can
than see the document in their own submission link.
**. It is your responsibility to be part of a group. You will not be able to complete this coursework as an
individual!
NOTE: - Part of this task is the management of working together as a group to emulate industrial working

Task 2 - Group Task – The NETWORK Contract
As a group you are expected to act as a contractor pitching a tender for a project based on a client
scenario. The client has put together a specification of requirements for you, the contractor, to design,
deploy, maintain and dismantle a computer network for an outside event they are running. The
specification can be found in Moodle, in the coursework section.
The specification may be incomplete and lack detail, as the client is not a network specialist (hence why
they need a network contractor). Therefore, as a group, you may need to agree assumptions for any gaps
in the specification. (This is not unusual in industry.)
*So what do I need to do for Task 2?*
As a group you are expected to pitch (present) your tender for this contract in your practical classes (for
dates see Schedule of Deliverables on page 1).
The tender is a set of slides that you submit to Moodle on 22nd March 2024 by 16:00
The tender must contain as a minimum:
● Any assumptions made with a rationale to why this is an assumption
o This should include any issues that may influence your design
● Security – State how you will secure the whole network (cover both physical and digital security)
● A complete design of the network you plan to deploy for the event specification.
o There are two key design aspects to this
▪ Logical Design – what components will be used, showing the interconnection
between them. This is similar to the type of design you have previously develop in
Packet Tracer (See general notes for a clear definition);
▪ You will develop the logical design in Cisco Packet Tracer checking all
connections are working.
▪ Physical Design – exactly where on the physical site, the components will be placed
including all cable runs etc. This plan needs to be detailed enough that the network
can be deployed directly using this design. You will need to use the site plan for this
task (See general notes for a clear definition)
● A formal Invoice containing all the required costings for your company to fulfil the contract
(Components and ALL Costings). An example is provided in Moodle in the coursework section.
● References (exceptionally a reference slide at the end is acceptable for this work)
**PASS/FAIL Requirement**
You are required to submit a group contribution form along with your presentation slides. On this form,
you will list all group members and as a group agree if each individual member contributed to the
coursework or not. This will include the attendance of groups members at the peer review sessions.
For any group member deemed to not have contributed, you need to add an explanation as to
‘why’ and with evidence as applicable.
Peer Review - Group Task – Design Feedback (for dates see Schedule and Deliverables on page 1)
These sessions will consist of one group peer reviewing another groups design (As stated above e.g. the
logical or physical design). The allocation of the groups will be decided on the day by the practical tutor.
One group will act as the client, to evaluate the work of another group, acting as the contractor, ensuring
the designs fit with the requirements of the client specification. Each group will act as both client and
contractor within each session. The client will complete an evaluation form for their contractor during these
sessions. This will emulate an acceptance of the design, with the aim to judge whether the reviewed design
accurately covers the coursework specification, again following industrial practices.
Each group can then use this feedback to improve their designs before they submit their final work
PTO
Task 3 - Group Task - The Pitch (presentation)
ALL group members need to attend this session
You will pitch (present) your tender (slides) during your timetabled practical session. (For dates see
Schedule and Deliverables). The aim of the pitch is that it’s a professional pitch to a client that you wish to
win a contract from.
These will take the form of a group presentation during your timetabled practical sessions. All group
members are expected to be part of the presentation. As a group you will be promoting your design to the
client (the class) as a contract tender. You will present the actual slides that you have submitted previously
to Moodle in task 2.
A professional approach is expected for the Pitch.
All students that are not currently presenting will be acting as clients and will be expected to engage in the
questioning at the end of each presentation.
Students who do not present without a valid ECF will forfeit those marks awarded to the group for task 3.
Duration: 15 minute presentation (strict time limit); 5 minutes (approximately) for questions

Marks and Feedback:
Verbal feedback will be provided during the 3 feedback sessions during practical’s from both
students and staff. Some feedback will also be provided during the pitches.
Formal end of coursework marks and feedback will be available 20 working days from the
submission date stated above. This does not include those days that the University are closed
over holiday periods.

Plagiarism
The final slide must have proper references using the Harvard APA 7 referencing system see the
University library Harvard APA FAQs. (http://referencing.port.ac.uk/)
The plagiarism disciplinary policy will be invoked if ANY part of this work is found to be directly
copied from the Internet printed / published work or another student. Using any AI tool to pass
output as your own work is also deemed as being plagiarism. Which will result in marks being
deducted for poor scholarship and possibly resulting in NO marks being be awarded for the entire
assignment. 

Coursework Marking Scheme Overview

whole site logistics 25 marks
Full Invoice; (this should reflect the requirements of your actual design, considering all your
costs) 10 marks
Contract Pitch – All group members need to attend this to gain the marks

terminology, clarity of the diagrams and how you work together as a group
during the presentation) will be considered
15 marks
General Notes:
Logical Design: is a conceptual, abstract design. You do not need to deal with the physical implementation
details yet. This section will incorporate the topology and how the technology connects to make the whole
communication system. Throughout this aspect of the design you need only ensure that you adhere to the
network infrastructure specification as detailed by the company and any physical constraints imposed that
will affect this stage of the design. This can be accomplished by using Packet Tracer.
Physical Design: Physical design is incorporating the logical design into the physical space. This has the
focus of taking your logical design and then showing how it will fit into the actual physical location. This is
where you consider the actual location of the components and the cable plans. Also consider the actual
building constraints etc.
practices. Therefore, it is the responsibility of all group members coll
